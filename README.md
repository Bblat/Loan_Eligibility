# Introduction
Obtaining a bank loan is an important financial decision for individuals. However, determining loan eligibility can be a complex task for banks. This project aims to simplify the loan eligibility assessment process by leveraging an ANN model that analyzes various client features and predicts their eligibility for a bank loan.

By training the model on historical data containing client information and loan eligibility outcomes, we have achieved significant accuracy and performance in predicting loan eligibility. This enables banks to make faster and more accurate decisions, streamlining their loan approval process.
